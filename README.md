## Project-V
Simple Machine Learning Model to see Patterns in House Prices 

## Key Features
- **Data Preparation:** We’ll clean and preprocess our dataset, effectively handling missing values, outliers, and categorical data.
- **Model Training:** We’ll train and evaluate several machine learning models specifically designed for regression tasks.
- **Data Visualization:** We’ll visualize the relationships in the data and highlight feature importance for clearer insights.
- **Future Predictions:** Once we have our trained model, we’ll save it for making predictions down the line!

## Technologies Used
### Languages:
- Python

### Libraries:
- **Data Handling:** pandas, numpy
- **Visualization:** matplotlib, seaborn
- **Machine Learning:** scikit-learn, XGBoost, LightGBM
